 *  a. do not have 'KEEP:' in their inline comment AND
 *  b. have not been added to the organization recently (if passed through NEW_MEMBERS) AND

 *  a. do not have 'KEEP:' in their inline comment AND
 *  b. have not been added to the repository recently (if passed through NEW_REPOSITORY_COLLABORATORS) AND
 *  c. have not performed any activity on the repository they're a collaborator of in the past X months.
